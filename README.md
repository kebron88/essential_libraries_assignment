Complete this assignment by filling in the function definitions and pushing your work back to your forked repository. Note about the test cases: you will see that in this assignment, the test cases are not written out explicitly for you. This is because in the real world, you are not handed test cases to check your code, you need to come up with them yourself! Writing out the test cases is not required for this assignment but it is highly recommended. If you do, make sure to keep your code under the "if __name__ == '__main__'" clause. This statement means that the code written under this clause will only be executed by running the program explicitly (eg. running "python question1.py"). For these questions, there are results written out that the functions should output if written correctly but just like in the functions and classes assignment, you should not tailor your functions to work specifically on these test cases. They should work properly given any inputs.
